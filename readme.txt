* Your document has to be available online for the embed views to work. The <strong>viewers do not support local host, intranet</strong> and files hosted in any password protected environment

* The <strong>viewers can handle files of a limited size only</strong> (Maximum 8MB for Google Docs Viewer and 10MB for Microsoft Office Online)

* The <strong>download and pop-out buttons cannot be removed</strong> - Any feature that comes by default with the viewers cannot be removed or altered
