## Frequently Asked Questions

* How do I add documents?  
Once the plugin is activated you can find ‘Add Document’ button in your WordPress visual editor. Just click on that and follow your heart.

* File not found error in my localhost site!  
The viewers (Google Docs Viewer and Microsoft Office Online) do not support locally hosted files. Your document has to be available online for the viewers to access.

* I have another question that you must add in your FAQ.  
Great. Send it to ead@awsm.in. We will answer it as soon as we can.
